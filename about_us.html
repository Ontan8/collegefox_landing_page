        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="text">
          We believe that the current situation for renting flats is quite
          strenuous and tedious, especially for college students. Improving it
          for ourselves and others was our motive from the very beginning and we
          have been working persistently to make it a reality. CollegeFox lets
          you advertise and search through properties that are much more to your
          liking and fit your needs. Our website is an open forum where buyers
          and sellers can exchange information easily, economically and rapidly.
